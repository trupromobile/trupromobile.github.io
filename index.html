            <div class="panel infoBox__content lightGreyBG">We provide dealer level computer and module reprogramming services. This service is provided when replacing these modules or installing factory updates. We can provide this service on most makes and models. This is an added benefit because typically you would need to go to the dealership for this service, but we can take care of this onsite. Why is this important? Making sure that your car computer is up to date with current software and firmware is important, as it can correct or prevent driveability issues, such as poor fuel economy, lack of power, hard shifts etc.</div>
